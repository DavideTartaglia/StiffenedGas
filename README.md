# StiffenedGas
A very simple Julia module to calculate pressure, temperature or density of a substance according to the stiffened gas equation of state (EoS).

It does not require additional packages, you only need to have Julia v1.5.

Feel free to include it in your projects.

Using it is very simple:
* If you are using a julia editor (e.g., vscode), or simply running julia from the command line, you just need to copy this repository in your project directory. Afterwords, add to the file in which you plan to use calculate a variable using the stiffened gas EoS the following lines:
`include("PATH_TO_THE_StiffenedGas.jl_FILE")
`
you only need to copy this repository in your project directory.
